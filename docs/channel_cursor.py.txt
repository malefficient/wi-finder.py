# Channel 'Cursor' explained.


When it comes to radio signals of any kind, human beings have a natural inclination to to simplify things as much as practical.
*for 'things' == to 'A descriptin of the PHY layer with enough precision to successfuly demodulate information

This tendency gives humans a convenient abstraction to work with. 
1) "Hey Johnny, tune in to Q101.1 with madcow at 10:00 AM for your chance to win tickets to STP"
2) "Be sure to stay tuned to WLS AM-890 to get the latest alternative-facts and disinformation from conservative pundit XYZ"

Odds are that as a human steeped in linguistic context, had no trouble understanding what either example above is referring to. 
(Which, for the record is)
FM channel 101.1
AM channel 890.

In fact, in casual conversation simply saying "101.1" or "channel 890" would suffice.

When use conversationaly in english, a 'channel' can be defined as a single-dimension variable.

In the US and Canada, the VHF television band occupies frequencies between 54 and 216 MHz and the UHF band between 470 and 890 MHz. 
In general, VHF channels are numbered 2 to 13 and UHF channels 14 to 51.

For any given medium, it is much easier for humans to create a mechanism/naming convention to map channels to specific frequency and modulation types.
"CBS Chicago on channel 2" -> 204Mhz (VHF)


## Wi-Fi evolution and implicit channel variables.
2.4 GHz (802.11b/g/n/ax) 
Fourteen channels are designated in the 2.4 GHz range, spaced 5 MHz apart from each other except for a 12 MHz space before channel 14

Channel, F0, Range,  width of band
1, 2412, 2401-2423. : 22 MHz
